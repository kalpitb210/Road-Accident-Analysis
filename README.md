This dashboard was created by inserting and customizing the pivot charts of corresponding pivot table. 

For user friendly and interactive experience slicers and timelines were incorporated. Hyperlinks and connections were also added to necessary icons for seamless navigation.

This dashboard summarizes all the pivot table Data for a new user or developer or client to ease their work and gathered information. 

Total nine pivot tables were created to summarise the data and help identify trends in the dataset focusing on relationship between number of casualties and many factors such as- casualty type, vehicle type, road type, location etc. Monthly trends were also analysed for the years 2021 and 2022.



## Key Insights

- Car drivers form bulk of the casualties so they must be targeted for awareness camps and strict monitoring, periodic check-ups on safe driving.
- Extra safety measures should be placed Single Carriageway roads and they must be upgraded to double lane wherever possible.
- Understanding casualty distribution based on different road surface conditions helps pinpoint areas where road maintenance and surface improvements are essential.
- Urban areas should be targeted for interventions to improve road safety in specific and during daytime.
